# Reason

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=atom)](https://skillicons.dev) Atom
Ranking: A
Reason: It was a great editor but its slowly getting wrose as its been discontinued some time ago. #RipAtom

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=eclipse)](https://skillicons.dev) Eclipse
Ranking: C
Reason: Its really clunky, the theme is old and its light and dark themes are ugly, and the functionality is medicore at best.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=idea)](https://skillicons.dev) IntelliJ IDEA
Ranking: S
Reason: Its the ultimate java IDE, its not a S+ because it has limited language and framework support and its quite limtied with the free tier.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=neovim)](https://skillicons.dev) Neovim 
Ranking: A
Reason: Its a quite efficent Editor, its pretty cool, i havent used it much but from what my friends say its quite cool.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vim)](https://skillicons.dev) VIM
Ranking: C
Reason: Its very efficent but extremely hard to learn, while it may pay off i belive its not worth it.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=visualstudio)](https://skillicons.dev) Visual Studio
Ranking: C
Reason: Its not good, its ugly, its clunky, its mainly for .net, its not even that good of a IDE, i dont like it much, and there are better alternatives like jetbrains Rider.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode)](https://skillicons.dev)
Ranking: A
Reason: its a solid editor with plugins and things but i love jetbrains products more because when using jetbrains products you simply open the project and code but with VSCode you need to install dozens of plugins and things which can be fun, but the reality is 90% of the time your just trying to fix some random-plugin related issue with VSCode.

# Other Info
This is just a cool list i made with my opinion if your ide of choice is not here its because the icon resource i use (skillicons.dev) dosent have it so open a issues in #issues, and if this project gets 50+ stars ill work on my own icon sharing resource.
